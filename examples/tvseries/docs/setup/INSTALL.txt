TVSeries Installation
=====================

After installing IEPY, you will have to:

 - install system packages
    sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
 - go to the examples folder
    cd examples
 - install tvseries dependencies:
    pip install -r tvseries/docs/setup/requirements-base.txt
 - Download Wikia dumps for the desired series.
 - Create your corpus:
    a) For each serie you want to incorporate, you will have to run wikia_to_iepy.py script like this:
        python tvseries/scripts/wikia_to_iepy.py <path_to_dump_pages_current>.xml.gz <DB_NAME> <NUMBER_OF_SEASSONS>

    Please notice that for some series you will have to specify how is the format of some wikia Category Tags in order proceed, or the number of seasons.
    If in doubt, for seeing the help msg run:
        python tvseries/scripts/wikia_to_iepy.py -h

    You should dump all series to the same database.

    b) Run the preprocess pipeline
        python tvseries/scripts/preprocess.py <DB_NAME>

TVSeries Installation
=====================

After installing iepy, you will have to:

 - install MongoDB
 - install tvseries dependencies:
    pip install -r tvseries/doc/setup/requirements-base.txt
 - Download Wikia dumps for the desired series. We provide as examples the dumps
   for House and Greys Anatomy, on the tvseries/wikia_dumps folder
 - Create your corpus:
    a) For each serie you want to incorporate, you will have to run a dump-to-iepy
    like this:
        python tvseries/scripts/wikia_to_iepy.py tvseries/wikia_dumps/house_pages_current.xml.gz db_series 8

    Please notice that for some other series you will have to specify how is the format of some wikia Category Tags in order proceed, or the number of seasons.

    You should dump all series to the same database.

    b) Run the preprocess pipeline
        python tvseries/scripts/preprocess.py db_series
